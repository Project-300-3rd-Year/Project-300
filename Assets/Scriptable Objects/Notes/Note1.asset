  text: "My name is Jerome Williams. I am freshly ordained exorcist. A week ago I
    received a letter from a Bishop. He was asking me to go and investigate a certain
    family living in an old house on the outskirts of a small backwards town. I sent
    out a reply and few days later a package arrived with documents, pictures and
    what seemed like interrogation transcripts with a small note with the address.
    On Christmas Eve I took a train and arrived at a town called \"Melas\". I checked
    in the motel and decided to ask locals about the family. They did not want to
    talk about it at all and even more than that they would not look me in the eye.
    It was unusual but I decided to leave it. I\u2019m in my room and it is close
    to midnight now. This town seems strange. There is no noise after dark, not even
    a dog barking. I am probably just being paranoid. Tomorrow I will go to talk
    to Romanovs. The family name sounds familiar, but I can\u2019t recall where I
    heard it before. "
